## For translators or mod creaters

Feel free to create your own translation patch for your language. Send issues to let me put your patch link in this README. 

Go to this [wiki](https://github.com/sallys-workshop/Localyssation/wiki/To-create-a-game-translation) page for guidance of installing the mod and creating your own language translation patch, as well as making your own [Font Bundles](https://github.com/sallys-workshop/Localyssation/wiki/Font-Bundle-aka.-Why-characters-don't-get-displayed-(2.0)) (make sure using **profitable & embeddable** fonts to avoid potential legal issues).

Localyssation supports mod translation after `2.0.0`, check this [wiki page](https://github.com/sallys-workshop/Localyssation/wiki/To-create-a-mod-translation) for more information.

Also, this mod can't help with the texts inside pictures. Try texture swapping if you'd like to translate them.
